## instructions
install a recent version of Python and the `wxpython` library, then run `main.py`. 
theres no way to change the mine count or board size in the GUI yet, so you have to edit the `game_size` and `game_mines` lines in main.py.  
to change the theme, set the `THEME` variable in main.py.
